TME

This code package is for the Tensor-Maximum-Entropy (TME) method. This method generates random surrogate data that preserves a specified set of first and second order marginal moments of a data tensor, which makes it well equipped to test for the null hypothesis that a structure in data is an epiphenomenon of these specified set of primary features of the data tensor. The random surrogate data are sampled from a maximum entropy distribution. This distribution unlike traditional maximum entropy method have constraints on the marginal first and second moments of the tensor mode.
